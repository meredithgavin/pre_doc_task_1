Labor Force Participation from 1976 to 2015
Data Source: U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS)

Question 1
(a) Please summarize the key trends for wages and labor force participation.

The "lfp_timeseries" plot examines aggregate labor force participation between 1977 and 2015. There is a significant jump in individuals observed both in the labor force and not in the labor force around 2001. This is consistent with the 2001 survey sample increase of 10,000 (https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsjul2001.pdf). The data shows some variation over time consistent with sample size changes. Dips in observations in the labor force are consistent with dips not in the labor force and vice versa up to the 2000 mark. Post-2000 we see a dip in labor force participation and a rise in observations not in the labor force. This may be associated with economic downturns, in which individuals left the labor market entirely. Additionally, the data may reflect a change in population age breakdowns. As the population ages, without equal replacement, the number of individuals not in the labot market would increase and the number of individuals in the labor market would decrease. This is consistent with observations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/labor-force-participation-what-has-happened-since-the-peak.htm).

The "wages_timeseries" plots total wages over time from 1977 to 2015. The plot indicates relatively constant growth in mean and median wages over time, with a slight divergence in mean and median starting around 2000. The mean wage appears to increase at a higher rate than the median wage. This is constistent with an increasingly right-skewed distribution of wages. The increasing difference in mean and median wages over time may be associated with changes in high and low income brackets, where high income individuals see greater wage growth than middle and low income individuals.
